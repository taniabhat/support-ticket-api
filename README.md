# Support Ticket API


This project contains **a number of hidden bugs**. Your task is to **debug and fix them**. The goal is to solve as many as you can—it’s okay if you don’t find all of them.

**Reference:** The correct API behaviour is defined in [api-specifications.md](api-specifications.md). Use it as the source of truth.

**Workflow:** Fork this repository and do all your work (and commits) in your fork.

**Code quality:** Read and understand the existing code and your own changes. Don’t apply fixes without understanding what the code does and why you’re changing it.

**AI tools:** You may use AI tools. If you do, you **must share the relevant chat history with us during the interview**.

### Mandatory for the interview

- Bring your laptop.
- Ensure the project is set up on your machine before you come.
- If you used AI, have the chat history ready to share.
